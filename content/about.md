I am currently a Design Apprentice at 8th Light, working on mastering my visual, UI, and UX design chops. New media artist on the side, helping dancers interact in interesting ways with tech. At my previous job, I helped develop a library-based makerspace, providing public access to tools like laser cutters and (ugh of course) 3D printers. Design has been a common theme in my journey. I also have two cats whose names are Froley and Hobbes.
