For my branding / visual design project, my design brief was to tackle the Olbrich Botanical Garden in Madison, WI as a rebranding project. For context, I had done some branding / logo work in the past, but never at a more specific level as this project. The work I've done in the past had always had branding as a side to a full web redesign and development, so this project was super exciting to tackle considering that I would need to shelf some preconceptions in my design process in order to streamline this one.

My design brief is simple at its core: rebrand Olbrich and its sub-brands (a limited list of their gardens), and develop marketing materials for a "new" garden that features carnivorous plants. Their goals for this were to appeal to a younger audience, and to bring together the brand ecosystem to unify the company as one visual direction.

Some deliverables to consider were:

- User interviews
- Competitor analysis
- Process sketches, color palette development, and font research
- 2-3 Mood Boards and/or Style Tiles
- Brand identity development
- Custom icon set
- Style Guide and/or Pattern Library
- Data visualizations (i.e. infographics, graphs, etc.)
- Print collateral mockups (i.e. brochure, posters, t-shirts, mugs, van wrap, etc.)
- Homepage website design
- Social Media Marketing
- Art direction (i.e. digital advertising/marketing campaign, photography, illustration)

And finally the presentation was to features:
• A pitch of design choices (3 logo options)
• Pitch of marketing concepts
• Responsive homepage mockup of new brand identity.

## Deciding on a methodology

Because my previous projects had been in UX/UI and also implementation, an early piece of feedback I received was that I was focusing too much on the web experience, and should be looking at the gardens as a whole, with more focus on the visual design element. That helped me to decide to actually go visit a botanical garden here in Chicago (couldn't make a trip out to Madison logistics-wise) and study how the brand manifested itself physically throughout the gardens.

The process was super helpful, and though it was winter, and most of the outdoor plants were dead or dying, it was actually helpful because I could see signage, wayfinding, and also how buildings used their fonts, colors, and logo on different surfaces, shaping the visitor experience.

I also researched some other components specific to Olbrich, like their mission and vision statements, goals they might have, and also how the brand becomes diluted across different social media platforms and other marketing materials. All of this played a role in helping me define an outcome statement:

> Create a flexible, sustainability-focused brand identity for Olbrich Gardens that celebrates its history and prepares it for the future. Support its various attractions to improve accessibility and visibility, both within the state and with tourists to Madison, WI.

From that point, I could begin experimenting with colors, typography, shapes, and more.

## Competitor Analysis

Although most of my competitor analysis was through the web, I was able to get a good sampling of flavors that other gardens present. Some were more updated than others, and some have more branding presence than those with just their name in plain text. Overall, there's not a whole lot going on design-wise for many of these gardens (which is understandable given their specialties, and perhaps budget).

That being said, there is a clear advantage in having a strong brand, even for a mostly non-competitive field. Botanical Gardens have to compete for attention against zoos, museums, tourist features, and be accessible to those from other cultures/languages, those with physical and/or mental disabilities, and families with children.

## Final Logos

These three represent my final logos that I presented. I did draw up some others that I decided not to include in my final presentation as they were close enough to these logos, and I wanted to represent logos that were different enough from each other to merit a distinct direction.

These slides show a brief view of the process to get to those logo-marks, which take their inspirations from different parts of the process. I can say that especially with visual design, the more time you have to spend on experimentation, the better serendipitous results you arrive at – I took a bit of a photography-based philosophy on this branding project: Take 1000 photos in order to find the few good ones.

## Additional Collateral

From there, it was a matter of deciding on the font choice, and determining which one would support the vision statements. On top of those, I ended up experimenting with some patterns, shapes, and photographic guidelines for the brand.

## Sub-Brands and the Gardens

Admittedly, I worked on these before I even started the logos. It helped to work on these and get into a more creative workflow in order to discover new branding opportunities. Given that I had been too focused on creating a dynamic, responsive web environment, I took to this task and was able to generate illustrations for each of the gardens.

## Closing Thoughts

I think there were a lot of great discoveries that were made in this process, and given the two-week deadline, I'm fairly pleased with the results. Though, given more time, or with a real client, I would implement more check-ins to discuss direction, and even perhaps implementing a design studio to dive deeper into the various directions, to get down to a single logo.

I got really positive feedback, and some really great critiques as well – here are some things noted from the end of the presentation:

- Provide some more examples of how the square logo (a dynamic mark) could be used to help illustrate how it's unique in its format. And, experiment with more shapes
- Integrate more of a floral element in my architectural logo.
- The Carnivorous Gardens illustration stands out a bit too much – finding a way to integrate it a bit closer to the other illustrations through the line work.
- Making the images larger on the bus stop advertisements.
- Add slides on my contextual inquiry research at the Chicago Botanical Gardens
- Use of the directional single-quote mark instead of the straight single-quote (')
