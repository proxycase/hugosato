Both interviews this morning/afternoon went well, and represented quite different experiences of how banking plays a role in our lives. KD, who is part of the older Millenial demographic, sought the help of a financial advisor along with her husband, to figure out future savings and investment opportunities. LN, a younger Millenial, used only one bank, the USAA, made for families of veterans and enlisted individuals. Both experiences were primarily or only web-based, and relied on the mobile app to interface directly with the bank.

KD listed issues with her banking experiences like not being able to trust 3rd party apps, and in particular stopped using Chase Quickpay when they started using the external Zelle system, mostly out of a gut reaction. She also doesn’t use Google Pay or any NFC-based payment because she doesn’t know what’s going on there and doesn’t trust it. 
Seeing the ease and “hipness” of Venmo, she relies primarily on that for money transfers between her and others. LN also uses Venmo for the same purposes, though the reason why she only uses limited services is less about trust and more that she simply uses an excel spreadsheet to manage her budget. She knows about other budgeting softwares, but never bothered.

LN said the only pain point she had is when travelling, she had issues with her card not working at Korean ATM’s. She expected issues while travelling in Japan because she heard from a peer that that might be an issue, but it worked fine in Japan, while her account would not be recognized in Korean ATMs, forcing her to rely on her travel-mate for cash. It would be nice, considering that many of the budgeting features tend to highlight savings for travel, to have clear answers about where your card can and cannot be used, and what to expect when travelling.

KD uses a third party app, Qapital, to invest and donate rounded-up money to charities and to stock. She expressed concern about it linking to her bank account, but she said it doesn’t bother her for now. The pros of the service outweigh the potential trust issues with a 3rd party handling her money. She also mentioned that she gravitates towards services and companies that share her philanthropic values, like how Wintrust has a program to go into communities to help increase financial literacy.



## *Interview with KD*

*	Works at a large non-profit, and communicates with high-value donors all the time. Director role.

*	Uses a financial planner, interested in investments, and looking for starting points.

*	Entirely has banking experience through Chase, and avoids paper banking as much as possible. Uses the mobile app for everything.

*	Trust is very important to how she uses applications. When Chase Quickpay switched to Zelle, she stopped using their service altogether and switched to Venmo.

*	Uses services that fit into her daily life, as well as follows the values she has about philanthropy, and ethical standards of the companies driving those products.

*	Uses a round-up service to donate up to $2 to charity for each purchase she makes.

*	Responsive to gamified tasks, like saving money or donating money to unlock achievements. Likes services that help build good habits.

*	Wished she had more help from the bank in understanding options when it came to student loans. Didn’t feel a personal connection with the Chase branch, and lacked financial literacy. 




## *Interview with LN, 27*

*	Uses USAA bank, which is her only bank and besides Venmo, are the only banking apps she uses. USAA has no branches, only a webpage and app.

*	She can use her phone to take pictures of checks and deposit them.

*	At ATM’s, all of her fees are paid for because they don’t have a physical branch.

*	Only major issue she encountered with USAA is that their credit card didn’t work when she travelled to Korea. Was able to buy things in-store but not at ATMS.

*	Every interaction she has with the bank is mostly through the app, including in-app chat. When there are major problems, however, she does call them and they are fairly responsive and quick to fix problems.

*	She is more comfortable in her finances, so when she does budgeting, it’s to understand an overall cashflow; to see percentages of money going to certain places and is less concerned with exact numbers.

*	She sections off money she is saving for bigger purchases, like travel.
