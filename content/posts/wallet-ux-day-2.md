## Tasks
* Competitive Analysis synthesis
* Send out surveys
* Interviews
* Synthesize Interviews to Themes
* Start building deck

After sending out the survey last night, I got about 10 responses to a variety of questions about banking and budgeting. 100% of the responses were self-identified as Millenial, which makes sense but also the right audience for the project. I think what is most telling about the difference between my interviews and the survey-takers is that the interviewees tended to have entirely online banks, and the survey-takers had credit unions, and had also chosen banks based on their physical proximity to them. This led to slightly conflicting information, which is good – since it acknowledges the fact that people use and choose banks for a lot of different reasons.

Some are happy with them and they don’t worry about it too much, while others seek higher interest rates, less fees, seek credit unions that benefit their locality, or have more complex needs regarding investments and saving for buying a home. One survey noted they wanted to have everything in one place instead of four, and that they would like to use a bank that has no international fees one day.

For budgeting, while some do not budget at all, some people use a variety of apps, and some use traditional methods, like spreadsheets or pen/paper. When people do use apps, the rate at which people stick with them tends to waver. However, apps like Credit Karma tend to stick mostly because you want to continue to be updated about your credit score and see your progress. Contextual suggestions are really nice too, where you get “offers” and suggestions based on your credit score, and income.
